/*
 *  array_merge
 *  Merges the elements of one or more arrays together so that the values of one are appended to the end of the previous
 *  one. It returns the resulting array.
 *  If the input arrays have the same string keys, then the later value for that key will overwrite the previous one.
 *  If, however, the arrays contain numeric keys, the later value will not overwrite the original value, but will be
 *  appended. Values in the input arrays with numeric keys will be renumbered with incrementing keys starting from zero
 *  in the result array.
 *
 *  array_merge_recursive() merges the elements of one or more arrays together so that the values of one are appended to
 *  the end of the previous one. It returns the resulting array. If the input arrays have the same string keys, then
 *  the values for these keys are merged together into an array, and this is done recursively, so that if one of the
 *  values is an array itself, the function will merge it with a corresponding entry in another array too.
 *  If, however, the arrays have the same numeric key, the later value will not overwrite the original value,
 *  but will be appended.
