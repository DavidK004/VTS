/*


Why do strlen() and var_dump() show larger lengths?

In PHP, the strlen() function does not count characters — it counts bytes in the raw string data.

UTF-8 uses multiple bytes per character for any symbol that’s not part of the basic ASCII set.
For example:

A → 1 byte (0x41)

č → 2 bytes (0xC4 0x8D)

ő → 2 bytes

í → 2 bytes

So while mb_strlen() “understands” that each of these is a single letter, strlen() simply counts the bytes, resulting
in a higher number.

var_dump() displays the string length in bytes, just like strlen(),
but that is not its primary purpose — it is meant for debugging and inspecting variables, not for measuring text length.
